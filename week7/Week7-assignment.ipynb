Wrongly treating outliers can bias your data. If you know the outliers are in error, or you know that they are not important to your goals, you can drop them. However, sometimes you will want to examine why they are outliers, what they are telling you. In our example, you may want to figure out WHY these houses sold for less than they are worth. E.g. Are they in a particularly loud neighborhood? Once we know that we can decide whether or not to include them. As stated in class, preprocessing is a very subjective phase. For the homework assignment, however, we will drop both of these outliers.\n",
