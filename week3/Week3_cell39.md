## Pre-processing a dataset: when are ready for ML?
* ~~Ideally, data are organized as a table: examples-vs-features~~
* ~~Data from multiple sources are combined~~
* Missing data are handled
* Features have been combined and manipulated as needed
* Any data that need to be normalized have been normalized
* Data are of correct type (e.g. categorical vs continuous, boolean vs int)
